# Buoy

The purpose of this library is to supply Common Lisp implementations
of non-trivial mathematics functions for floating-point numbers.

The current implementation of the single-precision version of the sin
and cos functions (the only functions currently provided) is based on
RLIBM, but we recommend instead using the more comprehensive
[core-math](https://core-math.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) library.
